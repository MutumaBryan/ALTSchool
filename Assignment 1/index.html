      <h2>WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOL</h2>
      <p>
        I learnt of the school from a friend while searching for a design
        focused course.<br />

        further helped me make my choice, the items in offer were aligned with

        and content of the course makes it the best front-end course
        available.
